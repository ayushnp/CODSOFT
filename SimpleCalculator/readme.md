# Simple Calculator in Python

This repository contains a simple calculator program implemented in Python. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and square root.

## Features

The calculator can handle the following operations:

-   Addition (`+`)
-   Subtraction (`-`)
-   Multiplication (`*`)
-   Division (`/`)
-   Modulus (`%`)
-   Square root (`sqrt`)

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x must be installed on your system.

You will be prompted to enter an operator. Supported operators are:
  -   `+` for addition
    -   `-` for subtraction
    -   `*` for multiplication
    -   `/` for division
    -   `%` for modulus
    -   `sqrt` for square root
-   After selecting the operator:
    
    -   If you choose `sqrt`, you'll be prompted to enter only one number.
    -   For other operators, you will need to input two numbers.

### Edge Cases

-   If division by zero is attempted, the program will notify the user that the denominator cannot be zero.
